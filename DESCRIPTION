Version: 0.0.1
Author: Arthur Welle
Maintainer: Arthur Welle <arthurwell@gmail.com>
Description: Pipes are an excellent way to code for they make it easy to follow the code chain of transformations and theis results. 
    The codehover aims to make it easy to create a HTML table with a simple hover effect (JQuery + CSS) that shows images just bellow this table.
    This way one could set up lines of pseudo-code in a table and a series of images showing the intermediary results of said code.
